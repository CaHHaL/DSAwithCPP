// You are given an integer n representing the number of rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1. Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array meetings[][] where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] indicates that a meeting is scheduled during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All starti values are unique.

//     Meeting Allocation Rules:

//     When a meeting starts, assign it to the available room with the smallest number.
//     If no rooms are free, delay the meeting until the earliest room becomes available. The delayed meeting retains its original duration.
//     When a room becomes free, assign it to the delayed meeting with the earliest original start time.
//     Determine the room number that hosts the most meetings. If multiple rooms have the same highest number of meetings, return the smallest room number among them.

//     Examples:

//     Input: n = 2, meetings[][] = [[0, 6], [2, 3], [3, 7], [4, 8], [6, 8]]
//     Output: 1
//     Explanation: Time 0: Both rooms available. [0,6] starts in room 0.
//     Time 2: Room 0 busy until 6. Room 1 available. [2,3] starts in room 1.
//     Time 3: Room 1 frees up. [3,7] starts in room 1.
//     Time 4: Both rooms busy. [4,8] is delayed.
//     Time 6: Room 0 frees up. Delayed [4,8] starts in room 0 [6,10).
//     Time 6: [6,8] arrives but both rooms busy. Itâ€™s delayed.
//     Time 7: Room 1 frees up. Delayed [6,8] starts in room 1 [7,9).
//     Meeting counts: [2, 3]
//     Input: n = 4, meetings[][] = [[0, 8], [1, 4], [3, 4], [2, 3]
//     Output: 2
//     Explanation: Time 0: All rooms available. [0,8] starts in room 0.
//     Time 1: Room 0 busy until 8. Rooms 1, 2, 3 available. [1,4] starts in room 1.
//     Time 2: Rooms 0 and 1 busy. Rooms 2, 3 available. [2,3] starts in room 2.
//     Time 3: Room 2 frees up. [3,4] starts in room 2.
//     Meeting counts: [1, 1, 2, 0]
