// You are given an integer n, there is a n Ã— n chessboard with a Knight starting at the top-left corner (0, 0). Your task is to determine a valid Knight's Tour, where the Knight visits every square exactly once, following the standard movement rules of a chess Knight (two steps in one direction and one step perpendicular), for example if a Knight is placed at cell (2, 2), in one move it can move to any of the following cells: (4, 3), (4, 1), (0, 3), (0, 1), (3, 4), (3, 0), (1, 4) and (1, 0).

// You have to return the order in which each cell is visited. If a solution exists, return the sequence of numbers (starting from 0) representing the order of visited squares. If no solution is possible, return an empty list.

// Note: You can return any valid ordering, if it is correct the driver code will print true else it will print false.

// Examples:

// Input: n = 5
// Output: true
// Explanation: A possible Knight's Tour in a 5x5 chessboard is given below where Each number represents the step at which the Knight visits that cell, starting from (0, 0) as step 0.
// [[0, 11, 2, 17, 20],
//  [3, 16, 19, 12, 7],
//  [10, 1, 6, 21, 18],
//  [15, 4, 23, 8, 13],
//  [24, 9, 14, 5, 22]]
// Input: n = 4
// Output: true
// Explanation: For n = 4, it is not possible for a valid Knight's Tour so you have to return [].
